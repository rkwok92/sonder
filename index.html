					<h2>Connect like humans</h2>
					<p>You have purpose in life. That's why you woke up this morning. Ever wonder why 7 billion other people did too? <br>Life is too short to see through one view, peek into someone else's today.</p>

				<div class="third">
					<h2>Share your story</h2>
					<p>Someone nearby wants to learn about your unique experience as much as you do their's. Grab coffee, a quick bite, or just sit by a park. This is your show, your interview.<br>Sonder today and be inspired.</p>

					<h2>Meet the inner beauty</h2>
					<p>Pictures are nice, but it detracts from the values of making deep-rooted and organic interactions. That's why we don't ask for pictures. <br>Give your eyes a rest, expand your mind.</p>
